🧬 AI for Biomolecular Condensates
Overview

This project is a simple educational Streamlit web app that conceptually explores how physicochemical properties of biomolecules — such as charge, hydrophobicity, intrinsic disorder, and molecular length — might influence their propensity to form biomolecular condensates.

The app demonstrates how AI models, even simple ones, can be used to represent biological hypotheses and visualize potential trends.

⚠️ This tool is for educational and illustrative purposes only — not based on real experimental data.
🔍 Background

Biomolecular condensates are membraneless organelles that form through phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids.
Understanding their formation and stability is central to explaining mechanisms underlying cellular organization, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer biology.
🚀 Features

Interactive Streamlit interface for inputting basic molecular parameters.

Uses a simple logistic regression model to estimate condensate formation likelihood.

Displays real-time predictions with confidence scores.

Serves as an introductory example for how machine learning can support hypothesis-building in biological systems.
