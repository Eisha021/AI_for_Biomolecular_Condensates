# 🧬 AI for Biomolecular Condensates

## Overview

This project is a simple **educational Streamlit web app** that conceptually explores how physicochemical properties of biomolecules — such as **charge, hydrophobicity, intrinsic disorder, and molecular length** — might influence their **propensity to form biomolecular condensates**.

The app demonstrates how **AI models**, even simple ones, can be used to represent **biological hypotheses** and visualize potential trends.

> ⚠️ This tool is for educational and illustrative purposes only — not based on real experimental data.

## 🔍 Background

Biomolecular condensates are **membraneless organelles** that form through **phase separation** of proteins and nucleic acids.  
Understanding their formation and stability is central to explaining mechanisms underlying **cellular organization**, **neurodegenerative diseases**, and **cancer biology**.

This demo draws conceptual inspiration from **research on condensate biophysics and molecular organization in disease.**

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive **Streamlit interface** for inputting basic molecular parameters  
- Uses a simple **logistic regression model** to estimate condensate formation likelihood  
- Displays **real-time predictions** with confidence scores  
- Serves as an introductory example for how **machine learning can support hypothesis-building** in biological systems
